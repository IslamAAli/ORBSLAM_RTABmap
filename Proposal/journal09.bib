  abstract  = {The use of the odometry and SLAM visual methods in autonomous vehicles has been growing. Optical sensors provide valuable information from the scenario that enhance the navigation of autonomous vehicles. Although several visual techniques are already available in the literature, their performance could be significantly affected by the scene captured by the optical sensor. In this context, this paper presents a comparative analysis of three monocular visual odometry methods and three stereo SLAM techniques. The advantages, particularities and performance of each technique are discussed, to provide information that is relevant for the development of new research and novel robotic applications.},
